- In the file 'Building_Combined' a fifth building (BT5) with a battery storage is added into
the central optimization problem. 
- In 'SetUpScenarios' parameters of a battery system are added
- The battery building optimization problem has not been tested

- ToDos (if battery building should be included)
	- Test optimization problem in 'Building_Combined'
	- 'ICSimulation'
		- Implement check method BT5
		- Implement conventional control method BT5
		- Implement single Time slot method for BT5
	- ANN
		- Include BT5
